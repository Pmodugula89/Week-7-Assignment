KANO Model Applied to GitHub:
1.	Basic Needs:
o	Version Control and Collaboration Tools are fundamental to GitHub and expected by every user. Their absence would lead to dissatisfaction, but they do not necessarily increase satisfaction beyond a certain point.
o	Performance for Large Repositories is a critical need for many users and must be met to prevent user frustration.
2.	Performance Needs:
o	CI/CD Automation and Security Alerts are features that improve the productâ€™s performance and directly impact user satisfaction. More robust automation and security features lead to happier users.
o	Improved Search Functionality helps users manage their projects more efficiently and satisfies the need for faster, more intuitive navigation.
3.	Delighters:
o	Mobile App Usability and Integration with Project Management Tools are features that can exceed user expectations, making them feel delighted and providing a competitive edge.
o	File Size Improvements and Notification Management could provide users with a more seamless experience, though they are not seen as critical.
