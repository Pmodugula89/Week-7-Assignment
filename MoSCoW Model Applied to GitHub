MoSCoW Model Applied to GitHub:
1.	Must-Have:
Version Control and Collaboration Tools are core features necessary for GitHub’s primary function. These are indispensable for version tracking and collaborative development.
Performance Improvements for Large Repositories are crucial for maintaining usability and performance as GitHub repositories grow.
2.	Should-Have:
o	CI/CD Automation (e.g., GitHub Actions) and Security Features (e.g., vulnerability scanning) improve the developer experience but are not as critical as version control and collaboration.
o	Improved Search Functionality is important for users to efficiently navigate large projects.
3.	Could-Have:
o	Mobile App Usability and Integration with Project Management Tools (e.g., Jira) are features that would enhance the user experience but are not as urgent.
o	File Size Limitations Improvement can be helpful for certain types of projects but is less of a priority for the majority of users.
4.	Won’t-Have:
o	Notification Management Features are seen as non-essential and not immediately required for GitHub’s current scope.
