Here's an example of how you could structure the README.md file for your GitHub repository based on your MoSCoW prioritization project.

MoSCoW Prioritization Project
Project Title: MoSCoW Prioritization for Feature Management
Description:
This project demonstrates the application of the MoSCoW prioritization technique in managing and organizing project features, tasks, and requirements. The goal of the project is to help decision-makers prioritize what features to implement in a software product or project. The MoSCoW method categorizes requirements into four levels:
1.	Must Have (essential and non-negotiable),
2.	Should Have (important but not urgent),
3.	Could Have (nice to have but non-critical),
4.	Won't Have (not a priority for the current iteration).
In this repository, we apply MoSCoW to a sample software project, showing how to assess and prioritize features to guide the development process.
Purpose:
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the MoSCoW technique can improve decision-making processes in software development by ensuring that the most important tasks are tackled first. This approach helps in efficiently allocating resources and ensuring timely delivery of high-priority features.

Setup Instructions:
1. Cloning the Repository:
To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following Git command:
git clone  https://github.com/Pmodugula89/Week-7-Assignment.git
This command will create a copy of the repository on your local machine.

3. Installing Dependencies:
This project doesn't require any external dependencies for the MoSCoW prioritization example. However, you may want to set up your environment for tracking and managing tasks. If you plan on extending the project with additional tools or features, follow the installation steps below:
1.	Install Python (if needed):
o	Download Python
o	Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.
2.	Install additional dependencies (if required):
If you plan to extend this project (e.g., integrating with project management tools, creating a web interface), you might want to install additional Python packages.
You can create a virtual environment and install dependencies using pip:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

You can add dependencies to the requirements.txt file as needed.

Usage:
Once you've cloned the repository, you can explore the following:
1.	MoSCoW_Matrix.xlsx: This file contains a filled-out MoSCoW prioritization matrix, providing an example of how to categorize tasks and features.
2.	MoSCoW_Presentation.pptx: This PowerPoint presentation outlines the project’s setup, implementation, feedback analysis, and prioritization process.
3.	GitHub Issues/PRs: You can also track the tasks and features for this project by viewing the issues and pull requests in this repository. You can add labels based on the MoSCoW priorities like must-have, should-have, could-have, and wont-have.

MoSCoW Matrix:
Here’s an example of how the MoSCoW prioritization technique has been applied to the project:
Task/Feature	Priority	Notes
Authentication System	Must Have	Critical for login and user management.
User Interface Design	Should Have	Important but can be postponed for later releases.
Email Notifications	Could Have	Enhances UX but not required for MVP.
Advanced Analytics	Won't Have	Not necessary for initial release.
________________________________________
Conclusion:
This project showcases the MoSCoW prioritization technique applied to a sample software project. By using this model, we ensure that the most important features are implemented first, and lower-priority tasks are deferred or ignored for the current iteration.
