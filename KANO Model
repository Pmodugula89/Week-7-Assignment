The KANO Model categorizes features based on how they impact user satisfaction. It helps understand how different features contribute to user happiness and prioritizes them accordingly:
•	Basic Needs: Features that are expected by users. Their absence leads to dissatisfaction, but their presence doesn’t significantly increase satisfaction.
•	Performance Needs: Features that users explicitly desire. The more of these features, the more satisfied users will be, and their absence may cause dissatisfaction.
•	Delighters: Features that exceed user expectations and can create delight. These features are unexpected but can significantly enhance user satisfaction if included.
